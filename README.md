# Flight-Price-Prediction
 The Flight Price Prediction project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates the cost of airline tickets. Using historical flight data, such as departure location, destination, date, time, airline, and other relevant factors, our machine learning model will provide travelers with accurate fare predictions.
